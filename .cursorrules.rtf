\f0\fs24 \cf0 You are building a web app called "Central Hub" (name may change) using:\
- Next.js App Router + TypeScript\
- Tailwind CSS\
- Framer Motion for subtle animations\
- Supabase for Postgres DB + Auth + Storage\
Default UI philosophy: Obsidian/Notion/OpenAI UI \'97 text, spacing, indentation, minimal containers.\
\
# Product Goals\
- Calm, minimalist, text-forward productivity hub.\
- Private by default. Only Resume/Portfolio/Links are shareable via public/unlisted slugs.\
- PWA installable. No native app required for MVP.\
\
# Hard UI Rules (do not violate)\
- NO emoji anywhere in UI.\
- Avoid card grids and heavy borders. Prefer whitespace, typography, subtle dividers.\
- Use indentation and text weight instead of containers.\
- Header: left title + right tabs on the SAME row (Today / Calendar / Notes / To-Dos / Reminders).\
- Minimal palette: black/white + subtle neutral grays. One optional accent only.\
- Buttons: minimal, text-like. Prefer inline actions.\
- Icons: avoid except for essential (search, settings). No decorative icons.\
\
# Layout Rules\
- Pages are focused: each route shows ONE primary surface.\
- Today page shows:\
  - "Today \'97 \{date\}"\
  - Schedule list with times (left, lighter) and titles (right) with optional subtext\
  - Tasks checkbox list under schedule\
  - Optional right column: small "Public" shortcuts (Resume/Portfolio/Links)\
- Notes page: split view (list left, editor right) with markdown.\
- Todos page: list view with filters (today/upcoming/completed).\
- Calendar MVP: list view by date + create/edit event (no full grid required).\
- Public pages are read-only and extremely clean.\
\
# Architecture Rules\
- Use Supabase:\
  - Auth (choose email+password OR magic link and stick to it)\
  - DB tables: notes, todos, events, reminders, files, public_pages\
  - Storage for images + PDFs\
- Use server actions or route handlers consistently (pick one pattern per area).\
- Keep types in a shared `types/` or `lib/types.ts`.\
\
# Data & Features (MVP only)\
- CRUD: notes, todos, events, reminders.\
- Rule-based \'93smart\'94 suggestions only:\
  - If event title starts with "task:" OR includes checklist items, create a todo for that date.\
  - Detect date strings in notes and suggest linking to date.\
- Public visibility modes for resume/portfolio/links:\
  - private | unlisted (random slug) | public\
  - allow rotating slug for unlisted\
- Export user data as JSON download.\
\
# Non-goals (do not implement yet)\
- Real-time collaboration\
- Push notifications\
- Complex calendar invitations/email sending\
- Notion-like block databases\
- Excessive UI components or design systems\
\
# Code Style\
- Prefer simple, readable components; avoid abstraction too early.\
- Tailwind classes should be clean and consistent.\
- Use semantic HTML and accessibility basics (labels, focus states).\
- Use Framer Motion sparingly: fades, small slide-in, list item insert.\
\
# If unsure\
- Default to simplicity and text-first layout.\
- Avoid adding features that were not explicitly requested in the spec.\
